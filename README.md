# Portfolio

## Welcome!

Hey there — this is my personal portfolio. It’s a place for me to post thoughts, share projects, and point people toward things I’ve been recently working on. I update it on a non-regular cadence, and as continuity wasn’t exactly a priority when I first threw it together, it'll inevitably be a bit muddled.

## Usage

This portfolio of mine is not intended to be used as boilerplate, although you are more than welcome to fork it and use it for your own portfolio. There is very little pagination and structure was never an intended thought in this programs creation, please bare that in mind.
