# Portfolio

## Welcome!

Hey there — this is my personal portfolio. It’s a place for me to post thoughts, share projects, and point people toward things I’ve worked on. I update it when I feel like it, and structure wasn’t exactly a priority when I first threw it together — but it works.

## Usage

This portfolio of mine is not intended to be used as boilerplate, although you are more than welcome to fork it and use it for your own portfolio. There is very little pagination and structure was never an intended thought in this programs creation, please bare that in mind.
